# ProtoPCBs

This is a collection of solderable breadboards. There are six different varieties based on two dimensions. One is the number of rows of tie-points (16, 32, 64) and the other is whether or not it includes power rails. 

## Dimentions

All ProtoPCB use 100 mil spacing between tie-points and 300 mil spacing in the center for allowing the use of DIP ICs.
